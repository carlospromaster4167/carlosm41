          <h3>How to Read These Profiles</h3>
          <p>
            Each profile highlights what a player brings to the team beyond
            basic stats. This includes leadership, defense, scoring ability,
            and overall impact during games.

          <p>
            Understanding player roles helps explain how the team functions
            as a unit rather than relying on one individual.
